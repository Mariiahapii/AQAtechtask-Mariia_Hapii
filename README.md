Triangle Analyzer, which I've made with the help of GPT-chat 
in order to solve the test techtask to the Automation Quality Assurance Internship 
in the TEAM International company.^_^



The Triangle Analyzer is a C# console application that takes as input the coordinates of three points in a 2-dimensional coordinate system and outputs various properties of the triangle formed by those points.

How to Use

To use the Triangle Analyzer, follow these steps:

Open the application in your preferred C# editor or IDE.
Run the application.
When prompted, enter the x and y coordinates of each of the three points.
The application will output the following properties of the triangle:
The length of each side of the triangle
Whether the triangle is equilateral or not
Whether the triangle is isosceles or not
Whether the triangle is a right triangle or not
The perimeter of the triangle
A list of even numbers from 0 up to the value of the triangle's perimeter
How it Works

The Triangle Analyzer uses the coordinates of the three points to calculate the lengths of the sides of the triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. It then checks whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or a right triangle based on the lengths of its sides. Finally, it calculates the perimeter of the triangle and outputs a list of even numbers up to that value.

Limitations

The Triangle Analyzer has the following limitations:

It only works with triangles in a 2-dimensional coordinate system.
It assumes that the input points are valid and form a triangle. If the input points do not form a triangle, the output may be unpredictable.
It may have precision issues due to the limitations of the double variable type.
